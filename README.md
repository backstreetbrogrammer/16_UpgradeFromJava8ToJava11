# Upgrade From Java 8 To Java 11

> Rather than having a major release planned for every two to three years, a new six-month feature-release-train
> model is being used: Every three years, a release is being designated as Long-Term Support (LTS) and receive
> quarterly security, stability, and performance updates only.

The current LTS versions of Java are Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17.

Oracle intends to support the Java LTS releases as follows:

- Java 8 through at least 2030
- Java 11 through 2026
- Java 17 through at least 2029

This project will focus on all new features added from Java 9 to Java 11, so that after upgrading from Java 8 to Java
11, we are able to use these new features in our code.
